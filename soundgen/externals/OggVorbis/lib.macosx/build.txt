 These are 64-bit libraries. If you need to build a 32-bit application and would
 like to use OpenAL/OggVorbis, you will have to create the 32-bit library files.

 How to build 32-bit libraries on a 64-bit machine with MacOSX:
 
   ./configure "CFLAGS=-m32" "CXXFLAGS=-m32" "LDFLAGS=-m32"
   make
   sudo make install
   make clean all install
 
 This way the .a files will be generated in /usr/local/lib
