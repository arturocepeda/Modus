  v0.53 (July 2013)
 =======================

 * Sample applications have been improved and cleaned. Now there is a common code for
   all the platforms
 
 * New timer based on std::chrono (platform-independent code)

 * Score scripts can be saved and loaded from binary files
 
 * All the projects and scripts are configured to compile with C++11
 
 * Now the clang compiler is used in MacOSX instead of gcc




  v0.52 (December 2012)
 =======================

 * Added support and examples for iOS

 * Added vibrato() method for instrumet objects

 * Added control pitch 132 to assign vibrato

 * Now it is possible to track the progress when loading sample-packs throgh a callback
   function that can be passed to the method loadSamplePack()

   NOTE: do not use this feature with the sample-packs included with an older version of
   Modus or sample-packs generated with an older version of the msamplepack tool, since 
   they do not include the total number of samples at the end of the file

 * Default value (NULL) set for the parameter Data when specifying callback funtions for
   MCTimer and MCInstrument objects




  v0.51 (October 2012)
 ======================

 * Added external libraries and examples for MacOSX and Linux

 * Instrument objects and sound generators have been optimized: their update() methods
   don't have loops throughout all the channels anymore, but now they use dynamic vectors 
   which store only the channels that must be checked

 * MCList has become a class template 

 * The addEntry() method in the MCScore class finds now the position through the 
   binary search algorithm instead of the linear search algorithm

 * The class hierarchy of the sound generators has now a more detailed structure. All 
   the included audio sound generators are derived from MCSoundGenAudioDoubleChannel

 * The damper pedal has now influence on the notes that are being released but still
   sound in the sound generators (handled as "resonance")

 * Added control pitch 131 to adjust sound generator's release time

 * For control pitch 128 (bending) the fields MDB and MDC are now free for the user

 * MCMIDIReceiver can now receive MIDI messages through byte vectors too




  v0.50 (August 2012)
 =====================

 * First release
